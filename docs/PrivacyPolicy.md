# LitSquare MD Privacy Policy

Updated: January 6, 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how the LitSquare MD macOS application handles information. LitSquare MD is developed by Thierry Charbonnel.

## What We Collect
- LitSquare MD does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to the developer.
- The macOS platform may provide anonymized app analytics and crash reports through Apple’s services. These reports do not identify you personally. For details, see the Apple Privacy Policy at https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/.

## How Your Text Is Processed
- By default, LitSquare MD uses Apple Intelligence models on your Mac. When available on your device, text processing happens locally and does not leave your computer.
- You can choose other providers (Ollama and other third‑party AI providers). When you select a non‑local provider or configure Ollama to use a remote/hosted model, the text you submit will be sent to that provider according to their policies.
- You are in control of the provider selection at all times. The app shows which provider is active in the UI and remembers your last choice on your device.

## Providers and Data Policies
- Apple Intelligence (default): On‑device processing when supported by your Mac. Review Apple’s policies: https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/
- Ollama: Requires installation and setup. You may run local models (e.g., llama 3.1) or connect to some hosted models. Review Ollama’s policies: https://ollama.com
- Third‑party AI providers: May require your own API key and are governed by their own terms and privacy policies.

## API Keys and Local Storage
- For third‑party providers that require credentials, your API keys are stored securely in your macOS Keychain and are not transmitted to the developer.
- The app stores minimal preferences (e.g., your last selected provider) in `UserDefaults` on your device. No text you process is stored by the app.

## Location Data
- LitSquare MD does not request, access, monitor, or collect your device’s location.

## Data Sharing
- LitSquare MD does not share data with third parties on its own. If you choose a third‑party provider, your text will be sent to that provider to perform the requested processing, under that provider’s terms and privacy policy.

## Links to Other Sites
- The app may contain links to third‑party websites. We are not responsible for the content, privacy policies, or practices of external sites.

## AI‑Generated Content
- Content may be generated by Apple Intelligence, models served via Ollama, and other third‑party AI providers, depending on your selection.
- We are not responsible for the accuracy, appropriateness, or outcomes of third‑party model outputs, nor for the privacy policies or practices of those providers.
- Review each provider’s terms and privacy policies for how they handle prompts, outputs, retention, and training.

## Data Retention
- Because LitSquare MD does not collect data on our servers, we do not retain any of your content and there is nothing to request for deletion from us.
- Third‑party providers you choose may retain logs or content per their policies. Consult their documentation to manage retention or deletion.

## Additional Notes
- If Apple Intelligence is unavailable on your device, you may receive a notice in the app. You can continue by selecting a different provider, which may process data off‑device per its policies.
- Using Ollama locally keeps data on your machine; connecting Ollama to a hosted model may send data to that host. Verify your Ollama configuration.

## Changes to This Policy
- We may update this policy from time to time. Changes take effect when posted in the app or its documentation. Please review periodically.
