      <h1>LitSquare Ink MD Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Updated: January 6, 2026</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how the LitSquare Ink MD macOS application handles information. LitSquare Ink MD is developed by Thierry Charbonnel.</p>
<h2>What We Collect</h2>
<ul>
<li>LitSquare Ink MD does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to the developer.</li>
<li>The macOS platform may provide anonymized app analytics and crash reports through Apple’s services. These reports do not identify you personally. For details, see the Apple Privacy Policy at <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Your Text Is Processed</h2>
<ul>
<li>By default, LitSquare Ink MD uses Apple Intelligence models on your Mac. When available on your device, text processing happens locally and does not leave your computer.</li>
<li>You can choose other providers (Ollama and other third‑party AI providers). When you select a non‑local provider or configure Ollama to use a remote/hosted model, the text you submit will be sent to that provider according to their policies.</li>
<li>You are in control of the provider selection at all times. The app shows which provider is active in the UI and remembers your last choice on your device.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Providers and Data Policies</h2>
<ul>
<li>Apple Intelligence (default): On‑device processing when supported by your Mac. Review Apple’s policies: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/</a></li>
<li>Ollama: Requires installation and setup. You may run local models (e.g., llama 3.1) or connect to some hosted models. Review Ollama’s policies: <a href="https://ollama.com">https://ollama.com</a></li>
<li>Third‑party AI providers: May require your own API key and are governed by their own terms and privacy policies.</li>
</ul>
<h2>API Keys and Local Storage</h2>
<ul>
<li>For third‑party providers that require credentials, your API keys are stored securely in your macOS Keychain and are not transmitted to the developer.</li>
<li>The app stores minimal preferences (e.g., your last selected provider) in <code>UserDefaults</code> on your device. No text you process is stored by the app.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Location Data</h2>
<ul>
<li>LitSquare Ink MD does not request, access, monitor, or collect your device’s location.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<ul>
<li>LitSquare Ink MD does not share data with third parties on its own. If you choose a third‑party provider, your text will be sent to that provider to perform the requested processing, under that provider’s terms and privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
<ul>
<li>The app may contain links to third‑party websites. We are not responsible for the content, privacy policies, or practices of external sites.</li>
</ul>
<h2>AI‑Generated Content</h2>
<ul>
<li>Content may be generated by Apple Intelligence, models served via Ollama, and other third‑party AI providers, depending on your selection.</li>
<li>We are not responsible for the accuracy, appropriateness, or outcomes of third‑party model outputs, nor for the privacy policies or practices of those providers.</li>
<li>Review each provider’s terms and privacy policies for how they handle prompts, outputs, retention, and training.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<ul>
<li>Because LitSquare Ink MD does not collect data on our servers, we do not retain any of your content and there is nothing to request for deletion from us.</li>
<li>Third‑party providers you choose may retain logs or content per their policies. Consult their documentation to manage retention or deletion.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Additional Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>If Apple Intelligence is unavailable on your device, you may receive a notice in the app. You can continue by selecting a different provider, which may process data off‑device per its policies.</li>
<li>Using Ollama locally keeps data on your machine; connecting Ollama to a hosted model may send data to that host. Verify your Ollama configuration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes take effect when posted in the app or its documentation. Please review periodically.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Contact</h2>
<ul>
<li>Questions or suggestions? Open an issue on our public GitHub repository or contact the developer.</li>
